            <h1>NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE</h1>
            <p>The first destination I explored in 2024 was Nashville, Tennessee. This was by far one of the
                most fun trips I have ever been on. I went for spring break this year with a few of my friends to celebrate a friend's birthday. 
                This was the first time I had been to Nashville and the first time I had really traveled in a while. The last time I had really traveled before this was going to Florida to 
                visit a cousin a few years prior during spring break.</p>
            
            <h2>PROS</h2>
            <p>Nashville was an extremely cheap place to travel to. The plane ticket was around $100, 
                and all of the expenses surrounding living and food were pretty cheap as well. Living in Massachusetts, sometimes you forget that not everywhere else in America is as expensive to live in.
                Seeing an entire chicken sandwich meal sell for 7 dollars blew my mind. <br><br><!--new lines to seperate text--> One of my favorite parts about Nashville was all of the live music. As a guy who's been newly converted 
                into a country music fan, it was awesome to go to a place on Broadway and see live music on 3 different levels of one building. There's nothing like it.<br><br> The food there is also fantastic. 
              Like I mentioned before, the food there is extremely cheap compared to in Mass, but the food there is also just great. The Barbecue spot I went to, that I unfortunately
              cant remember the name of, was a spectacular spot right near Broadway. But the best and most charming spot in my opinion is the kebab and corndog stand right outside of 
            Broadway. I would pay money to see those guys again, and not just because the food was so good. </p>
            
            <h3>CONS</h3>  
            <p>The only con I can think of when it comes to traveling to Nashville, which can also be looked at as a pro, is that it's an extremely touristy location. People are dressing in cowboy
            outfits, with boots and hats they bought down the street. I personally don't mind something like that and think it's fun, but it's something to consider.<br><br>For a list of things to do in Nashville, I
